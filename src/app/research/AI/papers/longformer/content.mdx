[Longformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05150) (2020) used three different kinds of sparse attention to reduce complexity to $O(n)$.

1. Sliding window attention: Instead of attending to all tokens, each token attends only to a fixed window of $w$ neighbours on each side. If you have multiple layers, it's still possible for information for propagate from further along the sequence. The receptive field ends up being $l \times w$. This is similar to how CNNs build up global context from their local convolutions.
2. The authors also allow their sliding windows to "dilate", leaving gaps in order to become wider. They report that allowing different attention heads different dilation amounts worked well.
3. They also allow certain tokens to attend globally. For instance, the CLS token, which is used for text classification, or the question tokens in a QA setting.
