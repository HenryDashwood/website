Hawaii has passed [Senate Bill 3202](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=3202&year=2024) which will allow two accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, to be built on residential properties.

[Why OpenAI Could Lose 5 Billion This Year](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-openai-could-lose-5-billion-this-year)

And new Llama and Mistral models got released this week claiming to be close to frontier level. Lots of startups burn money during a land grab. Uber is the iconic example. Lots of journalists at places like the FT now look very silly.

But it's not obvious to me that there are outsized returns to being the no. 1 company in LLMs like there were in ride sharing or search engines or social media. The things that make LLMs better are more flops, data, and labelling. But crucially not the data from user interactions, at least not until there is a new RL breakthrough or we're able to deploy models in an environment with more useful feedback.

It's a great time to be a user with competition this intense. But it does make me think the labs aren't sitting on any major breakthroughs. Otherwise why are their models all so similar? The progress now seems to be more about grinding out incremental improvements to the training pipelines and driving down inference costs.

## Miscellaneous

Ben Thompson's recent pieces on the harm the EU is doing through overzealous regulation have been excellent. Brexit was probably net bad but I spend a lot of time feeling very relieved we've left.

Andrea Mantegna is one of the big names on the road from the medieval to renaissance world but isn't a household name like Raphael. This is a wonderful piece about him and the renaissance mind more generally.
