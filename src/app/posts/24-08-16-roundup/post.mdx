## China

[How Innovative Is China in the Electric Vehicle and Battery Industries?](https://itif.org/publications/2024/07/29/how-innovative-is-china-in-the-electric-vehicle-and-battery-industries)

Some err... strong policy recommendations in the above piece. But a very good overview of the state of things at the moment.

Meanwhile this month...

[Uber Partners With BYD on Putting Its Drivers Into 100,000 EVs](https://archive.ph/ibPwt)

> _Uber and BYD make no mention of the US in their statement, likely because the market is virtually closed off to the carmaker. President Joe Biden has vowed to increase tariffs on Chinese EVs to 102.5% this year, ratcheting up a rate that former president Donald Trump raised to 27.5% during his four years in the White House._

> _The European Union and countries including Canada have since followed suit in adopting or considering higher duties on Chinese EV imports, which could further complicate Uber’s objective for 100% of its rides in US, Canadian and European cities to take place in electric vehicles by 2030._

And [German industrial production is in decline](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/germany-fact-of-the-day-12.html)

This is mostly a story of Europe's self imposed high energy costs. But that won't stop people trying to find other answers.

Britain stands out for not having put up or proposed tariffs yet. Will be interesting to see how much our car market diverges this decade.

Also meanwhile...

[Revolutionary Math Proof No One Could Explain...Until Now](https://youtu.be/RX1tZv_Nv4Y?si=eQD_ptGqjshX_it7)

via Peter Woit, who writes at [his blog](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/):

_Frenkel covers a wide range of topics about unification in math and physics and the difference between these two subjects. While there’s a lot about mathematics, Frenkel also gives the most lucid explanation I’ve ever heard of exactly what string theory is, what its relation to mathematics is, and what its problems are as a theory of the real world._

_"And there too", Woland pointed backwards. "What good is your little
basement now?" The reflected sun faded from the windows. "Why go back?"
Woland continued, quietly and persuasively. "0 thrice romantic master,
wouldn't you like to stroll under the cherry blossom with your love in the
daytime and listen to Schubert in the evening?"_
