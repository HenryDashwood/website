The product rule is a fundamental concept in calculus used to compute the derivative of the product of two functions. If you have two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, the product rule helps you find the derivative of their product

$$
h(x) = f(x)g(x)
$$

with respect to $x$. Mathematically, the product rule states that:

$$
h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
$$

where $h'(x)$ is the derivative of $h(x)$ with respect to $x$, $f'(x)$ is the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, and $g'(x)$ is the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$.

## Examples

**Find the derivative of the product function $h(x) = (x^2 + 1)(3x - 4)$ with respect to $x$**

1. Define the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= x^2 + 1 \\
g(x) &= 3x - 4
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Compute the derivatives:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f'(x) &= 2x \\
g'(x) &= 3
\end{aligned}
$$

3. Apply the product rule:

$$
\begin{aligned}
h'(x) &= f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) \\
&= 2x(3x - 4) + (x^2 + 1)(3) \\
&= 9x^2 - 8x + 3 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

In Sympy this looks like:

```python
import sympy

x = sympy.symbols("x")

u_x = x**2 + 1
v_x = 3 * x - 4

u_prime = sympy.diff(u_x, x)
v_prime = sympy.diff(v_x, x)

w_prime = u_prime * v_x + u_x * v_prime

sympy.simplify(w_prime)
```
