[Shadow Workspace: Iterating on Code in the Background](https://www.cursor.com/blog/shadow-workspace)

Very cool blog by the Cursor folks showing some of the stuff they do behind the scenes. Not just a VS Code fork with a built in LLM chat window (though that is _very_ useful on its own).

And it's basically free since you can cancel your copilot subscription!

[Unveiling AVA: The Adaptable Footbridge and Lift System of the Future](https://expedition.uk.com/article/unveiling-ava)

> _AVA is faster to deliver and simpler to install compared to standard industry practices. The streamlined approval and design periods, coupled with the modular system featuring bolted connections, transform the assembly process. With internal cladding, glazing, and services installed before the bridge leaves the yard, only a single possession is required._

It's not particularly aesthetic but it is functional and cool to see real attention given to construction productivity and driving costs down

> _We’re continuing to engage with the MHRA. In fact, we have another scientific advice meeting in two weeks that we’ll be holding virtually. We’re excited to be working with the MHRA and hopefully doing part of our Phase 2 clinical trial in the UK._

> _To remind your readers, we were one of the first recipients of the UK’s ILAP program, the innovative licensing and access pathway, and that’s what really brought us to the UK. In addition to the good environment there, lots of collaborators, lots of innovation happening, especially in the imaging field in the UK._

> _The bad thing is that post Brexit, it seems that the MHRA has gotten a bit backlogged and isn’t able to keep up with our current demands on their time. It takes too long to get meetings and responses to applications currently. We’ve had to take our first human clinical trial to Australia, where it’s a faster, more streamlined, and cheaper process._

> _We are really excited to be working with some great people there. Stephen Nicholls, a world-renowned cardiologist, who we brought on as an advisor, has really helped pave the way and show us the ropes of how to navigate the system and get things going really fast in Australia. We think we’ll be able to efficiently get our trial done there._

Alternative Greenwich pub recommendations from a friend, after I mentioned the Trafalgar Tavern:

> _The Old Brewery if the weather is good. It has infinite space (as it spills into the grass in Wren's ORNC), and the setting is actually considerably nicer than Trafalgar, looking over the UNESCO world heritage site and the river_

> _Prince of Wales (Blackheath)_

> _Hare & Billet (Blackheath)_

> _Richard I (Greenwich)_

> _The Cutty Sark (pub, Greenwich, a few mins further along the riverside from Trafalgar). Oldest pub in Greenwich and it shows!_

> _Coach & Horses (inside the covered market)_

> _Gipsy Moth, but it's completely generic_

> _Guildford Arms is very nice with a big outside idea_
