# Website

This is the source code for my personal website, [henrydashwood.com](https://henrydashwood.com).

Running locally:

```zsh
npm run dev
```

## TODO

- Add a HomePage Single Type and add content to there
- Why is content scrolling horizontally on narrow screens?
- Am I loading content when just titles dates will do? Is that why they load slow?
